    <h2>A Little About Me</h3>
        <p>It was a lazy evening and I was casually viewing whatsapp status' on my phone when I saw this really attractive ad on my screen. I mean, who wouldn't pause to see what it was right? And so I tapped. Word after word, TJP was drawing me in. Hmmmm was it finally time to stop hibernating in the tech field?</p>
        <p>A little backstory you might be interested in is that I am not completely new to Tech. Lol, yeah. I was first a product designer, then nigeria just happened and I had no time to hold my computer.
        Also, bagging a job was becoming well,... frustrating. For the sake of daily tukay, I ventured into Graphics Design
        Lol, yes, I'm still very much involved in graphics. But you see, The Just Project Cohort 3 called me and I just couldn't say no.
        So here I am, super grateful to the organizers and every single person who has made this an actualization.</p>
